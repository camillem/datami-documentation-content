### An idea, and a quick proof it could technically work

As any idea, Gitribute's idea didn't come from a blank void.

The idea takes its roots in various things we experimented and discussed before between associates, along the years. 

- How could we use Git in a more efficient way ?
- How could Git relieve us from many things we don't want to do that much (maintain a backend server for instance) ?
- How can we make something useful and new for the open data movement ?

And as any idea it needed to take a first form to be refined.

The real first pieces of Gitribute's concretization weren't lines of code, they were the [architecture & schemas](/architecture) drawings. And paper is cheap...

We already had some experiences in some technologies, some of we wanted to experiment more with for instance to do widgets.

That laid - **an idea and a plan** - coding the "backbone" structure for the Gitribute project was jst a matter of a couple of days.
