### Data and schema agnostic

Data comes in every shapes and forms. 

Usually - if you did not produce this data - they come in forms you don't expected... at all...

A key idea in Gitribute is it should display **any data in a common format**, disregarding what's inside : **Gitribute tries to stay "data agnostic"**.

Taking this as the ground step for displaying data, we also wanted to append - if and only if necessary - more options so your data could be shown as beautiful you imagined it.

Knowing the more common way to write data were the "table" format, we included very early in our developments a keystone feature allowing **to apply a [table schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)** and other custom properties **to your `csv` or `tsv` files**.
