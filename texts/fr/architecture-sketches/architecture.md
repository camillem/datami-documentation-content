## Main ideas

ðŸš§  &nbsp; `Translation in progress...`

Gitribute is designed as a light micro-service, letting you chose among a small collection of widgets you can reuse to **display the data you want**, **where you want**, and all that **for free**.

To make this possible we designed Gitribute as a pure frontend.

No backend in Gitribute's stack : too much maintenance, to expensive, a pain in the *** to say the least...

That said, if we wanted to visualize any data _**the data did need to come from somewhere, ain't it ?**_
