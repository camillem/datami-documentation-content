## Dialog before saving changes (send a contribution)

ðŸš§  &nbsp; `Translation in progress...`

To "save" one's changes over a data, we use Git for version control.

More precisely we rely on Git service providers like Github or Gitlab. 

The [Git syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) could seem a bit tricky at first sight.

"Merge requests", "branches" and this kind of weirds notions are not terms your grandma' or grandpa' are _really_ interested in.

_( If they seem to, call a doctor.)_

At the contrary _"saving"_, a document became something quite usual for most humans in the XXIth century.

**"Contributing" lays halfway between the tech world and common cultural habits.**

The challenge was to find an "user path" - and a design - to express this intention **simply** and **honestly** :

- "Simply" by avoiding any dispensable information, straight to the point ;
- "Honestly" by letting the user learn step by step what those weird terms (tooltips), keeping technical information in the background (in another tab, but accessible), etc...

That said it is not completly useless to have a basic understanding of Git, and [many](https://www.atlassian.com/git) [websites](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=fr_FR), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh), or sometimes people are available to learn the basics.
