### Basic interoperabilty

ðŸš§  &nbsp; `Translation in progress...`

In the "tech" world - and especially in the open source movement - "full interoperability" is the Graal we all crave for. Http protocol, RSS, XML, Semantic web, activityPub, were or still are great inventions reaching for this goal.

Digital world is full of standards, tools, frameworks, languages, uses, etc... Some standards are adopted and widely accepted, other are struggling to become so.

Many actors (corporations or else) fight to defend their own standard(s), which is always better than the competitor's standard, and it goes on and on...

_A little though here for the mini-disc standard, the blu-ray, and many other standards who died fiercly... And a less tender though for Apple and their habit to change plugs shape every ten minutes._

But this tech world could seem... you know... kinda very technical, at least for "normal" people.

Try to explain the pros and cons of semantic web to your grandpa' or grandma', I dare you.

So instead of "extensive interoperability" we prefer to imagine Gitribute posture about this topic as reaching for the **"best interoperability between noobs & machines"**, as the combination of :

- **"What people commonly use"** : excel spreadsheets, gsheet, airtable... for instance.
- **"What could be read by any machine today"** : `json`, `csv`, `markdown` ...

We won't say Gitribute is interoperable, it's just it tries to use standards having the best chance to be commonly used by human and machines **altogether**...
