### A widgets collection...

ðŸš§  &nbsp; `Translation in progress...`

Gitribute is constituted by of a collection of widgets you can use separatly or compose with.

We didn't want to centralize a service and/or your data.

After all _you_ sweat to produce it, _you_ own it, therefore _you_ are responsible for it.

But if you want to **valorize** and **refine your data** the best chance to do so is to **let other people reuse and contribute to YOUR data**.

Sharing. [This is the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelA7KRLINA&ab_channel=Gabriel)...

"Sharing data" means letting people reuse YOUR data where THEY want.

Widgets are the solution we though of to allow this, without the risk to lose entirely the control over your data :

- The data source stays in _your_ repository ;
- But _anybody_ can make a proposal...

Let's dare say again that **"[Manners maketh commoner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUtNQAdhIR4&ab_channel=RodStickler)...** _you know what that means ?_"
