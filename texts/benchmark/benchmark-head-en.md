# Benchmark

While developping Gitribute we keep in mind there are other solutions on similar use cases.

All those solutions - including Gitribute - come with pros and cons. 

Some are open source, other proprietary. The vast majority store your data in the cloud, the open source solutions allowing yoou to chose to provide your own backend server (and assuming its maintenance). You need to pay for some, one way or another ("when it's proprietary and it's free you are the product"), etc...

We like open source solutions, no question about it.

But you know what we say about the "cloud" : it's just someone else's server. The data storage centralization does not cope with Gitribute main intentions and we think.
