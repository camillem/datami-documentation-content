## What is a contribution ?

Would you guess which difference between Wikipedia and Twitter we like to emphasize the most ?

**Someone can moderate what you wrote before making it public**

Contributing is a team-playing game, you can't contribute alone, it makes no sense.

We believe that allowing a **"peer review"** - even in the slighest and apparently meaningless documents anyone produce - leads to better documents. Some daily-life illustrations :

- _Before sending an important mail we can tend to have someone reading it over before sending it._
- _When correcting an article in Wikipedia, third persons are checking it back to verify the authenticity of your sources..._

If freedom of speech stays a core principle in a democracy, it takes at least two to have a chat isn't it ? And it takes at least two to build a shared knowledge.

Building a cooperative environment - digital or not - means opening what you think to others and let them have a right to modify those thoughts. Thus the object produced from those thoughts gets improved.

With Gitribute we wanted to **apply this logic and this ethic to any data or dataset** we can think of.

Above all we wanted to **allow non-technicians internet users to get a grasp on this practice** (did we mention your grandpa or grandma before ?).

The contributive internet we dream of is not similar to those endless lists of comments above a video on YouTube, nor to those endless threads on Twitter, where you feel people comment reactively. 

**We don't think just reacting to other people's thoughts helps build knowledge.**
