This section aims to give you some hints for using basic features of Gitribute.

Ideally we wouldn't want to write this section at all, given we are trying to design Gitribute as self-explanatory: a lot of tooltips are associated to the action buttons, so the user could directly have a glimpse of what every button does without having to jump to the docs.

But if we're honest we're not 100% sure our UX design will be clear enough, so tutorials could be a complementary tool to guide new users.

## Get on with Gitribute's main features

Some features are available globaly :

- **Show a file's infos**
- **Copy the widget's html code**
- **Manipulate the user options**
- **Switch between edit view modes**
- **Use the `save` button (send a contribution)**

More details about those features [here](/tutorial-actions)

## Edition features

Other features are quite useful but more specific to table files (like `csv`), for instance :

- **Switch between table and cards view**
- **Show external ressources**
- **Filter a table**
- **Make a text search across the table**

More details about the edition features [here](/tutorial-edition)

## Contribution features

Finally some fetaures are correlated to the core purpose of Gitribute : "Contribute with Git".

Making a open contribution to a document, including the possibility for the document's owner to reject or to modify it comes with some little perks and a bit of vocabulary.

- **What is branch ?**
- **What is a "pull request" or a "merge request" ?**
- **How do I know my contribution was accepted ?**
