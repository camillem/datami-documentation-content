## Change "view" et "edit" modes

Gitribute is primarly designed to edit data. So you can switch views between : 

- A `preview` mode
- An `edit` mode
- And also a `diff` mode, so you could see the difference between the original data and what you edited.

For tables files (`csv`, `tsv`) and table datasets (`mediawiki`) we felt the need to display the data also in another ways...

### Edit views / modes

#### "Preview" mode
#### "Edit" mode
#### "Diff" mode

### Specific actions

Some action buttons are only available for table data :

- **View modes** :
  - Table view
  - Cards view
- **Search fulltext**
