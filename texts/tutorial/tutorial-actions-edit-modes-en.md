Gitribute is primarly designed to edit data. So you can switch views between : 

- A `preview` mode
- An `edit` mode
- And also a `diff` mode, so you could see the difference between the original data and what you edited.

For tables files (`csv`, `tsv`) and table datasets (`mediawiki`) we felt the need to display the data also in another ways...

### Edit views / modes

<div>
  <img

    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/commented/tutorial-edition.png"
    />
</div>

This buttons group aims to simplify the navigation between the document's states when you are editing it.

#### "Preview" mode

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-PREVIEW_BUTTON"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/view-btn_preview.png"
    />
</div>

This is the default "edit-view" mode. It displays you the data as you edited it. If you don't have edited anything on the document yet, it shows you the source data as it is in the distant source file.

#### "Edit" mode

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-EDIT_BUTTON"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/view-btn_edit.png"
    />
</div>

If you have clicked on the "Edit" button or if you have clicked on this icon, the widget switches to the edit mode.

On this mode you can apply modifications to the data, depending on the type of data you are editing : `csv`, `md`, `json`...

For instance the `edit` mode for a `csv` (table) file looks something like this :

<div style="border: thin solid lightgrey;">
  <img 
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-EDIT_PREVIEW"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/edition-edit-csv.png"
    />
</div>

More about the "edit" mode in the [tutorial > edition](/tutorial-edition) section.

#### "Diff" mode

<div>
  <img
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-DIFF_BUTTON"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/view-btn_diff.png"
    />
</div>

The "diff" mode can be quite useful once you have finished editing it. It highlights the modification you have made, so you and the document's owner could distinguish what was already present in the source document and what is new thanks to your contribution.

For instance the `diff` mode for a `md` (markdown) file looks something like this :

<div style="border: thin solid lightgrey;">
  <img 
    alt="TUTORIAL-ACTIONS-EDIT_PREVIEW"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/multi-coop/gitribute-documentation-content/main/images/tutorial/edition-edit-md.png"
    />
</div>

More about the "diff" mode in the [tutorial > edition](/tutorial-edition) and in the [tutorials > contribution](/tutorial-contribution) sections.
