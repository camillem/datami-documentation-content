## Reuse one or several widgets

The easiest way to integrate a widget to your own website is to copy-paste an existing one.

To do so you just have to click on the "copy the widget's block code" on the top-right corner of the widget.

> **Note** : More details about the button "copy widget block code" in the ["Tutorials > Actions"](/docs-widgets-overview) section.
