### Valorize our expertise, not the code

No subscription nor private data will be generated from Gitribute to our benefit.

We won't make a dime from the code itself, but it doesn't mean Gitribute won't help our cooperative to grow.

**Gitribute is a growth vector from several perspectives** :

- It could be used as a pedagogic tool for us to **help organizations opening their data**, and as such in need for our expertise ;
- It could be a way to **work on more complex cases**, where organizations need to produce open data over open data, schema, and APIs ;
- Our technical **skillset grows** as we develop and innovate, **so is our global value as a structure**.
