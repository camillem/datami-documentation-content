### Mutualize needs  & converge with the roadmap

The main principle we try to follow when it comes to fund the developments of a product like Gitribute.

- Open source is not a hobby, it's a job. You need missions to fund it ;
- A product should respond to expressed needs ;
- Development on a product could benefit several clients, even if they don't know one another ;

During our carreer we could observe many actors in need for developments, emphasizing their particularities when comparing themselves to others. 

_[Nothing new under the sun](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissisme_des_petites_diff%C3%A9rences-)..._

Small differences, and - sometimes - huge similarities... if analyzed as such.

Many problems benefit from this patient time of analysis, factorization, optimisation that is the effort to mutualize problems to find a common solution.

The very advantage in the digital industry is a problem's solution could be very flexible and evolve through each of its steps of its development... if though as such, and if one is making this effort.
