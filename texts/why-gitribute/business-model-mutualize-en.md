### Mutualize needs  & converge with the roadmap

The main principle we try to follow when it comes to fund the developments of a product like Gitribute.

- Open source is not a hobby, it's a job. You need missions to fund it ;
- A product should respond to expressed needs ;
- Development on a product could benefit several clients, even if they don't know one another ;

During our carreers we could observe many actors in need for developments are emphasizing their own particularities when comparing themselves to others. 

_[Nothing new under the sun](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissisme_des_petites_diff%C3%A9rences-)..._

Small differences, while - sometimes - huge similarities...

But you can find if you are searching for it : you will only find similarities if you take the time to analyze individual needs altogether.

Many problems benefit from this patient time of analysis, factorization, optimisation that constitutes the effort of **mutualizing problems to find a common solution**.

In the digital industry the very advantage we have is that a problem's solution could be very flexible over the time, through each of its steps of its development...

But once more, only if though as such and if one is willing to make the effort.
