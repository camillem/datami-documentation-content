### A widgets collection...

Gitribute is constituted by of a collection of widgets you can use separatly or compose with.

We didn't want to centralize a service and/or your data. After all _you_ sweat to produce it, _you_ own it, therefore _you_ are responsible for it.

But if you want to **valorize** and **refine your data** the best chance to do so is to **let people reuse and contribute to YOUR data**.

Sharing. [This is the way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelA7KRLINA&ab_channel=Gabriel)...

"Sharing" means letting people reuse YOUR data where THEY want.

Widgets are a solution to allow this without the risk to lose entirely the hand on your data :

- The data source stays in _your_ repository ;
- But _anybody_ can make a proposal...

Let's dare say that **"[Manners maketh commoner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUtNQAdhIR4&ab_channel=RodStickler)...** _you know what that means ?_"
