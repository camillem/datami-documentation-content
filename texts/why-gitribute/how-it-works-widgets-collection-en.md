## Gitribute is a widgets collection

Gitribute is a web application providing a serie of "[widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget)". It means that **you could integrate it inside any website**, and you don't have to rely on a centralized website to use any of our widgets.

The term "widget" is equivalent to "web component", it's a way to display an independent dynamic component inside a website. The "widget" approach is similar to the old-fashion _iframe_, but is more flexible and adapted to modern web than the latter.
