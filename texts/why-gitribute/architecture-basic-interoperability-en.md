### Basic interoperabilty

In the "tech" world - and especially in the open source movement - "full interoperability" is the Graal we all crave for. RSS, XML, Semantic web, activityPub are or were great inventions.

Digital world is full of standards, tools, frameworks, languages, uses, etc... Many actors fight for their standard, always better than the neighbour's standard, and it goes on and on.

_A little though for the minidisc, the blueray, and many other standards who died fiercly... And a less tender though for Apple and their habit to change plugs shape every ten minutes..._

But tech is... you know... kinda very technical, at least for "normal" people. Try to explain the pros and cons of semantic web to your grandpa' or grandma', I dare you. 

So instead of "extensive interoperability" we prefer to imagine the **"best interability for noobs"**, as the combination of :

- **"What people use commonly"** : excel spreadsheets, gsheet, airtable for the noobs for instance.
- **"What could be read by any machine today"** : `json`, `csv`, `markdown` ...

We won't say Gitribute is interoperable, it's just it does use some standards having the best chance to be commonly used by human and machines altogether...
