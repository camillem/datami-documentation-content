# Why Gitribute ?

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about **what is open data**, and **what is open data for**.

Nowadays _open data_ is everywhere, and sometimes you don't even notice it. Wikipedia pages are crawled by startups, Open Street Maps data are reused by state or private entities, public data are re-published for public use...

Data helps governments in piloting their politics, startups to target customers and refine their commercial offer... For an actor **the data** - at least its available data - is what helps giving an **understading** of the actor's world, **sharing** this vision, **guiding** the actor in its actions, and consequently **reshaping** the world.

The question remains : usually **who can produce** this data ? Developpers, institutions, banks, startups, some NGOs, few media... Big structures, specialized engineers, big fellows.

Where is your grandpa or your grandmap in this picture ? your local non profit association ? They quite certainly know stuff about their land, the country they live in, interesting initiative in their neighbourhood.

In this the race to produce the data framing our world, we plead for a **better balance between "big and visible" producers and the "less visible" ones** : local or regional non profit organizations, small regional public services, unformal collectives...

We plead also for a **better interoperability between "grassroot" and "top-down" data**. If anyone can edit an excel table, anyone should be able to make that table understandable, reusable, improvable by oher actors.
