But let's rewind to the starting point of the Gitribute project.

There is no precise moment to think of, but those bits of (not so much) imaginary conversations will give you an idea of what was going on in our mind.

> _Any developper, slightly ironic_ :
>
> &nbsp; — *Why the hell* are you starting a project aiming to help contributing to simple things as a csv ?
> &nbsp; — I'd be you, I'd stick to more custom developments and do real serious projects...
> &nbsp; — Speaking of serious things I'm currently working on...blah blah...

> _Another developper, as smart as the previous_ :
>
> &nbsp; — I think [this tech](/benchmark) does it already. You gonna _reinvent the wheel !_
> &nbsp; — huhuhu
<!-- > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _( ...engineers )_ -->

> _An [open data](https://okfn.org/opendata/) activist_ :
>
> &nbsp; — You know I'm already using [this](/benchmark) or [that](/benchmark) solution. Do you know Airtable / Notion / GSheet... ?
> &nbsp; — Can't say I'm extatic but it does (some of) the job...

> _Your grandpa', your grandma', your neighbour... perhaps yourself_ :
>
> &nbsp; — Y'all seem to speak about important stuff and all...
> &nbsp; — **... But what the hell is a 'csv' ?**
> &nbsp; — ( Nevermind'em, let me use my good'old Excel )

At this point the alternative became quite clear :

- either enjoy the absurdity of the situation ;
- **OR** there was - perhaps - room for **something new to imagine**.

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about **what is open data**, and **what is open data for**.

Nowadays _open data_ is everywhere, and sometimes you don't even notice it. Wikipedia pages are crawled by startups, Open Street Maps data are reused by state or private entities, public data are re-published for public use...

Data helps governments in piloting their politics, startups to target customers and refine their commercial offer... For an actor **the data** - at least its available data - is what helps giving an **understading** of the actor's world, **sharing** this vision, **guiding** the actor in its actions, and consequently **reshaping** the world.

The question remains : usually **who can produce** this data ? Developpers, institutions, banks, startups, some NGOs, few media... Big structures, specialized engineers, big fellows.

Where is your grandpa' or your grandma' in this picture ? Your neighbour ? Your work colleagues ? Your local non profit association ? Yourself ?

They - you included - quite certainly know a lot of stuff concerning their land, the country they live in, or even the smallest interesting initiatives in their town. They are as **legitimate** and **concerned** by _open data_ than engineers, states, or corporations. But usually they are far less or well equiped to produce some useful open data themselves.

In this the race to produce this data framing our world, we plead for a **better balance between "big and visible" producers and the "less visible" ones** : local or regional non profit organizations, small regional public services, unformal collectives...

We also plead for a **better interoperability between "grassroot" and "top-down" data**. If anyone can edit an excel table, anyone should be able to make that table understandable, reusable, improvable by oher actors.
