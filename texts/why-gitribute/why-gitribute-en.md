# Why Gitribute ?

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about what is open data, and what is open data for.

## To make open contribution easier for any citizen

We arrived to the conclusion that _open data_ means that every kind of citizen should be able to contribute to any kind of data they are interested in, and they should not be restrained by their technical abilities.

Gitribute aims to provide interfaces as simple as possible to allow any person to contribute to open data, without having to create an account and give away private informations.

## To help institutions opening their data

The thing is that **producing** open datasets could be a very technical task. If any citizen should contribute, not any person or structure has the skills to produce clean datasets, maintain them, and moderate them...

## To reduce the costs of opening your data

**We are developping Gitribute so the cost to share and contribute to open datasets approaches zero.**

The most expensive part of maintaining any data infrastructure lies often in the servers. So we skipped them... How ? By using the most used and most free data infrastuctures already existing to store data : Github, Gitlab, or Mediawiki.

## To plead for quality data

Anybody who received spreadsheet files in their mail knows the challenges in reusing data you didn't produced.

Gitribute follows the trend of "frictionless data" and allows to **apply schema** to the tables you share in a widget.
