# Why Gitribute ?

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about **what is open data**, and **what is open data for**.

Nowadays _open data_ is everywhere, and sometimes you don't even notice it. Wikipedia pages are crawled by startups, Open Street Maps data are reused by state or private entities, public data are re-published for public use...

Data helps governments in piloting their politics, startups to target customers and refine their commercial offer... For an actor **the data** - at least its available data - is what helps giving an **understading** of the actor's world, **sharing** this vision, **guiding** the actor in its actions, and consequently **reshaping** the world.

The question remains : usually **who can produce** this data ? Developpers, institutions, banks, startups, some NGOs, few media... Big structures, specialized engineers, big fellows.

Where is your grandpa or your grandmap in this picture ? your local non profit association ? They quite certainly know stuff about their land, the country they live in, interesting initiative in their neighbourhood.

In this the race to produce the data framing our world, we plead for a **better balance between "big and visible" producers and the "less visible" ones** : local or regional non profit organizations, small regional public services, unformal collectives...

We plead also for a **better interoperability between "grassroot" and "top-down" data**. If anyone can edit an excel table, anyone should be able to make that table understandable, reusable, improvable by oher actors.

## To make open contribution easier for anybody

We arrived to the conclusion that _open data_ means that **any kind of citizen or organization** should be able to contribute **to any kind of data** they are interested in, and they should not be restrained by their technical abilities.

Gitribute aims to provide interfaces as simple as possible to allow any individual to contribute to open data, without having to create an account and give away private informations.

## To help organizations opening their data

The thing is that **producing** open datasets could be a very technical task. If any citizen should contribute, few people or structures have the skills to produce clean datasets, maintain them, and moderate them...

Gitribute aims to be a open tools among other to reduce the cost and the peniblity to create structured open datasets.

We take the bet that by helping opening public data to the contribution, organizations will see how a moderation process can also lead to share better quality data.

## To reduce the costs of opening your data

We are developping Gitribute so **the cost to share data, and contribute to it approaches zero**.

The most expensive part of maintaining any data infrastructure lies often in the servers. So we skipped them...

[How](/how-it-works) ? By using the most used and most free data infrastuctures already existing to store data : Github, Gitlab, or Mediawiki.

## To plead for quality data

Anybody who received spreadsheet files in their mail knows the challenges in reusing data you didn't produced.

Gitribute follows the trend of "[frictionless data](https://frictionlessdata.io/)" and some widgets allow to **[apply table schema](/docs-gitfile)** to the tables you share in a widget.
