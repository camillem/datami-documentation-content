# Why Gitribute ?

Let's sum up the starting point of the Gitribute project by those bits of (not so much) imaginary conversations.

> _Any developper, slightly ironic_ :
>
> &nbsp; — Why the hell are you starting a project aiming to help people contributing to datasets as simple as a csv ?
> &nbsp; — I'd be you, I'd stick to more custom developments and do real serious projects...
> &nbsp; — Speaking of serious things I'm currently working on...blah blah...

> _Another developper, as smart as the previous_ :
>
> &nbsp; — I know [this tech](/benchmark) that does it already. You gonna _reinvent the wheel_...
> &nbsp; — huhuhu
<!-- > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _( ...engineers )_ -->

> _An open data activist_ :
>
> &nbsp; — You know I'm already using [this](/benchmark) or [that](/benchmark) solution. Do you know Airtable / Notion / GoogleSheet... ?
> &nbsp; — Can't say I'm extatic but it does (some of) the job...

> _Your grandpa', your grandma', your neighbour... perhaps yourself_ :
>
> &nbsp; — Y'all seem to speak about important stuff and all...
> &nbsp; — **... But what the hell is a 'csv' ?**

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about **what is open data**, and **what is open data for**.

Nowadays _open data_ is everywhere, and sometimes you don't even notice it. Wikipedia pages are crawled by startups, Open Street Maps data are reused by state or private entities, public data are re-published for public use...

Data helps governments in piloting their politics, startups to target customers and refine their commercial offer... For an actor **the data** - at least its available data - is what helps giving an **understading** of the actor's world, **sharing** this vision, **guiding** the actor in its actions, and consequently **reshaping** the world.

The question remains : usually **who can produce** this data ? Developpers, institutions, banks, startups, some NGOs, few media... Big structures, specialized engineers, big fellows.

Where is your grandpa or your grandma' in this picture ? Your neighbour ? Your local non profit association ? Yourself ?

They quite certainly know a lot of stuff conerning their land, the country they live in, or even concerning interesting initiatives in their town. They are as legitimate and concerned by _open data_ than engineers, states, or corporations. But usually they are far less or well equiped to produce some open data themselves.

In this the race to produce the data framing our world, we plead for a **better balance between "big and visible" producers and the "less visible" ones** : local or regional non profit organizations, small regional public services, unformal collectives...

We plead also for a **better interoperability between "grassroot" and "top-down" data**. If anyone can edit an excel table, anyone should be able to make that table understandable, reusable, improvable by oher actors.
