# Why Gitribute ?

The Gitribute projects inherits from a lot a brainstorming about what is open data, and what is open data for.

We arrived to the conclusion open data means every kind of citizen should be able to contribute to any kind of data they are interested in, and as much as possible not be restrained by their technical abilities.

The thing is **producing** open datasets is a very technical task. If any citizen should contribute, not any person or structure has the skills to produce clean datasets, maintain them, and moderate them...
