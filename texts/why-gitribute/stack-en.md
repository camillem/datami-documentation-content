We only used open source packages and technologies, coz' that's what we do... :

- [`Vue.js` (2.x)](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide) : yes we like this framework a lot...
- [`VueX`](https://vuex.vuejs.org/): the data store shared for every web component ;
- [`vue-custom-element`](https://github.com/karol-f/vue-custom-element): wrapper for vue web components ;

- [`Showdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown) and [`showdown-table` extension](https://github.com/showdownjs/table-extension#readme): package to convert `md` content to `html` (see [docs for showdown extensions](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown#extensions));
- [`Bulma`](https://bulma.io/) and [`Buefy`](https://buefy.org/) : as UI frameworks for vue ;
