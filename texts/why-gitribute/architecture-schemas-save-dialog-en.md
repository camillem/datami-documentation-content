## Dialog before saving changes (send contribution)
"Merge requests", "branches" and those other weirds terms are not things your grandma or grandpa are _really_ interested in. If they seem to, call a doctor.

At the contrary _saving_ a document became something quite usual for most.

"Contributing" lays halfway between the tech world and common cultural habits.

The challenge was to find an "user path" and a design to express this idea **simply** and **honestly** :

- "Simply" by avoiding any dispensable information, straight to the point ;
- "Honestly" by letting the user learn step by step what those weird terms (tooltips), keeping technical information in the background (in another tab, but accessible), etc...
