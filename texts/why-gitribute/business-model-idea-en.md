### An idea, and a quick proof it could technically work

As any idea, Gitribute's idea didn't come from a blank void.

It started with an idea we experimented and discussed before between associates in different ways. 

- How could we use Git in a more efficient way ?
- How could Git relieve us from many things we don't want to do that much (maintain a backend server for instance) ?
- How can we make something useful and new for the open data movement ?

And as any idea it needed to take a first form to begin having any concrete refinement.

The real first pieces of Gitribute's concretization wasn't any line of code, it was the [architecture & schemas](/architecture) drawings. And paper is cheap...

We already had some experience in various technologies, some we wanted to experiment more like the widgets.

That laid - an idea and a plan - coding the "backbone" structure for the Gitribute project was a matter of some days.
