## Main features

ðŸš§  &nbsp; `Redaction in progress...`

Gitribute is constituted by a serie of widgets, each allowing to interact with ressources stored on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), [Github](https://github.com/), or [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

Each widget allows to play with your data in different ways :

- The [Gitfle](/docs-gitfile) widget allows you to display, share, and edit data stored on what we call a "Git provider" (Gitlab, Github) ;
- The [Multi-filea](/docs-multi-files) widget allows you to display multiple "Gitfiles" as many tabs in the widget ;
- The [Explowiki](/docs-explowiki) widget allows you to display and share data coming from a wiki  

The cornerstone widget is the Gitfile widget : this one make possible for anyone - with technical skills or not - to contribute on a dataset stored on Github or Gitlab, but without having to create an account or even without having to deal with Github or Gitlab at all.

Last but not least Gitribute's widgets are designed to be "copy-paste", so you could share the same source dataset in as many websites you want... for free !
