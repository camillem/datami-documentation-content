## To plead for quality open data

Anyone who received table data (a spreadsheet, a csv) in their mail knows the challenges in reusing - or even understanding - tables you didn't produced yourself.

Such data could come as either incomplete, not structured enough, some columns could be missing, some entries do not respect a referential, you'd need to geolocate your rows, etc... 

Delivered as such that kind of dataset is not "clean" nor ready for further uses.

**With Gitribute we try to adress this need for data consolidation**, mainly because that case is happening to uus daily at work with evrey client we work for : people's table data can always be "cleaner" or "better".

To do so we mobilized two different families of tools : 

- **Schemas**
- **Third party APIs**.
