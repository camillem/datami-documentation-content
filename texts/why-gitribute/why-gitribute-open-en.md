## To help organizations opening their data

The thing is that **producing** open datasets could be a very technical task. If any citizen should contribute, few people or structures have the skills to produce clean datasets, maintain them, and moderate them...

Gitribute aims to be a open tools among other to reduce the cost and the peniblity to create structured open datasets.

We take the bet that by helping opening public data to the contribution, organizations will see how a moderation process can also lead to share better quality data.
