### Data and schema agnostic

Data come in every shape and forms. Usually - if you did not produce the data - they come in forms you don't expected... at all...

A key idea in Gitribute is it should display any data, disregarding what's inside : **Gitribute tries to stay agnostic**.

Taking this as the ground step for visualizing data, we also wanted to append - if and only if necessary - more options so your data could be shown as beautiful you want it.

Knowing the more common way to wite data were the table format, we included very early in our developments a keystone feature, allowing **to apply a [table schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)** and other custom properties **to your `csv` or `tsv` files**
