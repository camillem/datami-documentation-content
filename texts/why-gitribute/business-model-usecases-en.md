### Real use cases

We worked with **real user cases** since we started to develop Gitribute, even in its early releases.

We begun to develop the first bricks of Gitribute as responses to one, then two, then three clients sharing similar needs.

Doing so we can **have real feedbacks** along all the development cycles.

Those first clients allowed us to **begin quickly**, with **short development cycles,** in an "agile" process, and deliver bricks responding to their specific needs.

_[Do it agile or do not, there is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No)..._

The fundings corresponding to those mfirst issions payed for the POC alone.
