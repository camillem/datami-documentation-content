## Main ideas

Gitribute is designed as a light micro-service, letting you chose between a small library of widgets you can reuse to **display the data you want**, **where you want**, and all that **for free**.

To make this possible we designed Gitribute as a pure frontend. No backend in Gitribute's stack : too much maintenance, to costly, a pain in the *** to say the least...

That said if we wanted to visualize any data, _the data did need to come from somewhere, ain't it ?_
