## Components wireframes

Gitribute started with an idea, while sitting at a cafe near Paris, outside, with a bright sun on a sunny sunday. No laptop around.

We started designing Gitribute a bit in an "old-fashion" way : with a pen and a paper. No fancy tools like Figma at this precise moment at the cafe.

Keeping on with this approach the "wireframes" you will se below are more ideas or sketches than real design canvases. But drawing can still be relevant and more straight-to-the-point, even in the digital world.

After all, how did they build those pyramids, any building, any painting, anything needing a bit of planning... before the computers ?
