## Components wireframes

Gitribute started with an idea, while siting on a cafe, outside, with a bright sun on a sunny sunday.

We designed Gitribute a bit in an "old-fashion" way : with a pen and a paper. No fancy tools like Figma at this moment in the cafe.

Keeping on with this approch the "wireframes" you will se below are more ideas than design canvases. But we think drawing can still be relevant, even in the digital world.

After all, how did they build those pyramids, any building, any painting, before the computers ?
