### Git providers as databases

As developpers ourselves we have an extensive use of Github or Gitlab, and let's say those are AMAZING infrastructures ! 

We (I mean we, developpers) daily enjoy those services providing :

- version management ;
- authentication ;
- APIs ;
- robust infras ;
- etc...

So if we developers store our data and code over there the whole time, let's keep it that way and letting you enjoy this same relief.

**Gitribute's prefered database is no database, so let it be Github or Gitlab**, and there's an extensive documentation to know how to get or modify the data via their APIs.

The other important feature those git providers provide is the ability to create `branches` and `pull requests`. Think of it as "contribution proposals" offered to the dataset owner : **the owner can accept, reject, or amend a proposal before merging it to its dataset**.

We consider the "pull request" and the moderation it leads to as the more polite way to collaborate. That kind of contribution have _manners_.
