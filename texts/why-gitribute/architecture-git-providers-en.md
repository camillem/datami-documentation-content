### Git providers as databases

As developpers ourselves we have a daily and extensive use of Github or Gitlab, and let's agree to say those are AMAZING infrastructures ! 

Every day, we (I mean we developpers) enjoy those services :

- Version management ;
- Secure authentication ;
- APIs ;
- Robust and scalable infrastructures ;
- etc...

So if we - developers - store our data and code over there the whole time, let's keep it that way and let you enjoy this same relief.

**Gitribute's prefered database is "no" database in a common sense, so let it be Github or Gitlab**. There is an extensive documentation to know how to get or modify the data via their APIs.

The other important feature those "Git providers" deliver us is the ability to create `branches` and `pull requests`. Think of it as "contribution proposals" sent to a dataset's owner : **the owner can accept, reject, or amend a proposal before merging it to its dataset**.

We consider the "pull request" - and the moderation it leads to - as the more polite way to collaborate : propose something to someone, and let they chose to accept it or not.

That kind of contribution process have _[manners](https://idiomorigins.org/origin/manners-maketh-man)_.
