### Widget for `csv` preview and edition

"Everything tends to look like Excel" _they_ say (mostly developpers).

Perhaps it does so because it is what human brain understand the most when it comes to lists : matrices, squares, cells, columns, lines or rows, what is there here to reject ?

Is everything looking like Excel, or is Excel just looking like something easy to understand and appropriate ?

Anyway, if we keep esthetics and philosphical mumbo jumbo aside let's say **table is good, table gets sh*t done**.

Gitribute adresses is the more common users as possible, so no overkill innovations concerning the UX ideas. We wanted an interface even Donald Trump could understand (even if this is not the kind of commoner we're looking for).

A table. 
A fulltext search.
Some filters.
Edit.
Save.
Download the data.
Change view type to cards view if you feel aventurous.

...Simple
...Basic

Once - and only once - those design principles put in place, we wanted to add extra but useful features to help anybody consolidate the dataset. The main and more original one being the **consolidation button** for every row, agnosticaly helping to get complementary data from external APIs ("api-entreprises", "BAN api", ...).
