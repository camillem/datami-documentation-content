## Install your own instance

If you have some technical skills when it comes to code, you can finally deploy your own instance of Gitribute and use its widgets as you wish.

Gitribute is a 100% open source project under [GNU AGPLv3 licence](/stack).

So please clone/copy/reuse, the only thing you'll need to do is to respect the terms of our licence : 

**We let you reuse it, so you keep it open sourced !**

> **Note** : More about local development and deployment in the ["Install > Quickstart for developpers"](/quickstart-developpers) section.
