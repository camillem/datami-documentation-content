## Adapt Gitribute for your website

We designed Gitribute so its widgets could be customized so you could use them to display your own data, the way you like it.

This documentation provides several examples of how a single Gitribute widget could be adapted to display any kind of data you want.

For instance the `<multi-gitribute-file>` widget alone can display several types of files : `csv`, `json`, `md`, `tsv`...

By changing the `gitfile` parameter in your `<multi-gitribute-file>` html block, you will be able to display the data you want...

More details about the widgets parameters in the ["Widgets" section](/docs-widgets-overview).
